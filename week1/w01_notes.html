    <h2>Week 01 Notes</h2>
    <h3>Empathize with the End User</h3>
    <p>Mobile is where the users are moving to; they have their heads in their phones, not their laptops. <br>

    In short, everything needs to be designed for mobile first. This is different than just doing a <br>
    responsive retrofitting (converting desktop to mobile), which does not prioritize catering to <br>
    mobile users (the number of users will only continue to increase due to low-cost & ease of use). <br>

    Anything that can be done to make it easier for the user should be done: reducing the cognitive <br>
    load, creating seamless interface, and increasing reachability.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Some examples of this: <br>
    <br>
    <b>RELEVANT</b> - an easier form; ask for only ESSENTIALS <br>
    <br>
    <b>IMMEDIATE</b> - pulling up the large numpad for number fields <br>
    <br>
    <b>FRICTIONLESS</b> - moving the menu bar to the bottom so it's REACHABLE <br>
    </p>
